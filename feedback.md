#What was your favorite part of the class?
I liked when you would check up on us. Throughout the whole semester, no other professor did that for us. I am grateful and it means a lot to me you would do that for us.

#What was your least favorite part of the class? 
I think I didn't like that we didn't have much of a break between the lecture. That made it a little hard to follow along.

#Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?
I think providing like some more example codes for us to look at when doing certain assignemnts. I think that would of helped me a bit more.
