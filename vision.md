#What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?
I want to work for the police force in being a crime analsyts! If I don't make it in that field, I think I would make it in the fire department. I know the City of Los Angeles has a department in where they have a GIS department for them. I jsut want to be somewhere where I can help people and be able to change the world.

#What GIS applications or technologies excite you most?
I think what always has excited me is ArcPro ONLY BECAUSE in undergrad, I got tramatized using ArcMaps and it was so different from Pro. I see the new technologies being added in like the different tools for buffering (who doesn't love a good buffer) and much more!

#What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
I think I want to focus on working out or starting up my weekly beach walks with my boyfriend. I had started the weekly beach walks to destress, but in the end, I just didn't have time anymore with the assignments and work. Another thing I want to get into is gaming. I miss picking up my Nintendo Switch and playing Stardew Valley. I miss being the average "gamer". OH! I would also get back into playing pokemon! I miss playing it.
